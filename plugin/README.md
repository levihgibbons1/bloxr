# Bloxr Plugin

This directory will hold the Luau Studio plugin for Bloxr.

The plugin runs inside Roblox Studio and communicates with the Bloxr server to provide AI-powered development assistance directly within the Studio environment.

## Planned Contents

- `Plugin.lua` or `Plugin.server.lua` — main plugin entry point
- Supporting Luau modules

## Notes

- This is a Luau project — no Node.js setup is needed here
- The plugin communicates with the `/server` backend over HTTP
